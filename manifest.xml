<!--

Default Elgg persistent login only supports one "remember me" at the time. You can't be remember on more than one browser/computer.

This plugin provides the ability to have yourself remembered on more than one place.

This plugin is updated for Elgg 1.8.

Be aware that this is a first (0.2) release and is a bit experimental. It would be appreciated if you could let us know if this plugin works.
